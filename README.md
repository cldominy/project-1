Wanted to hike the trails of Austin, but weren't sure where to start? Needed some help figuring out if there are easier trails to begin your fitness journey? Hike the Trails ATX (HTTATX) was created with a user like you in mind! This website dynamically generates up to 20 Austin trails in a list for you to click through. If needed, a user can select criteria to limit the trails, either based on length of the trail or on the difficutly of the trail. Once a trail is clicked on, the webpage dynamically updates with the a picture of the trail, trail information, and the location on Google Maps.
